            <h1 class="green ">Seven Wishes for the Dragon Santiago</h1>
            <p>A fantasy novel by Eric Davidson.</p>
            <p class="bordered-text">Dragons are raised by their ancestors, each leaving seven memories to be relived. When Santiago is born however, the memories marked by joy and kindness have been stolen, leaving behind only a cruel and terrible history. Together with a girl born on a nearby sea, and a knight with an unwieldy sword, Santiago seeks to find what has been taken and restore the true memory of the world.</p>

                    <h2 class="green">The Idea</h2>
                    <p>The first scene I had of this story was the image of a girl on a beach with a single coin, seeking to make a wish. Her choices were to throw it in a talking fountain, or give it to a talking dragon.</p>
                    <h2 class="green">Current Progress</h2>
                    <p>Over the past year, the idea has grown tremendously, and I am currently working on draft three, sitting at 73,000 words.</p>
                    <p>So for now I am in the "editing trenches". If you are there as well, I ask that we meet up occasionally to barter supplies. I am looking for motivation in exchange for some old cans of diced tomatoes.</p>
                    <h2 class="green">Goals</h2>
                    <p>I plan to pursue traditional publishing, and will begin soon querying when the entire manuscript feels polished from beginning to end.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in project updates or providing feedback on an early draft, <a class="orange-link" href="https://forms.gle/f2nG4o6uoS26z42W6">please consider filling out this form.</a></p>

            <h2 class="green">Chapter One Excerpt</h2>
            <p>The dragon’s name was only whispered once before it was forgotten.</p>
            <p>The memory lingered, and caught the sound and both were written into the world, leaving a cave on the side of the mountain. Not even the dragon’s mother could pronounce the edges and corners, but she placed the egg inside, and it stayed there long enough to define both the dragon and the stone. The facets became like mirrors for the dragon’s hue, such that when a wayward traveler found the cave seeking shelter long after and still long ago, he mistook the alcove for an emerald mine. He left to bring others, only to forget it as quickly as the dragon’s name.</p>
            <p>Others found it eventually, only instead finding amethyst and tourmaline, then citrine and alexandrite, and none of them knew it was because dragons never stay the same color for long. The illusory gems would match him for the length of his life, no matter how far away he ventured, or what new colors he found.</p>
            <p>The cave was evidence of a mind far from idle, as it walked through history. Each of the dragon’s ancestors had passed on a portion of their life, a chosen collection of seven memories, for each descendant to relive. It was the hatchling’s inheritance, a passage to cross emerging to form memories of his own.</p>
            <p>When the dragon emerged, his scales were mostly slate driven green, and slightly darker was the fur that started above his eyes between two copper horns, and ran down the full length of his body and a little past his tail. For his name, assuming you will not in fact have the opportunity to stumble inside and struggle to pronounce the facets, he would eventually be known by another name, one that would not be forgotten. In fact, there are people even now that when the right oddly shaped shadow passes by them backed by star-light, a thought occurs unaccountable to them, and they will whisper the name Santiago.</p>
            <p>Strange however that he was born far before his time, with a stone heart already broken and weary, having only walked through a fragment of the history meant for him. In fact it was the memories he did receive that had chased him into the world, all of them cruel enough that he willed himself to be born early, and dark enough that his first breaths were spent running towards the first light he could see.</p>
