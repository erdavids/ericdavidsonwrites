            <h1 class="green ">Seven Wishes for the Dragon Santiago</h1>
            <p>A fantasy novel by Eric Davidson.</p>
            <p class="bordered-text">Dragons are raised by their ancestors, each leaving seven memories to be relived. When Santiago is born however, the memories marked by joy and kindness have been stolen, leaving behind only a cruel and terrible history. Together with a girl born on a nearby sea, and a knight with an unwieldy sword, Santiago seeks to find what has been taken and restore the true memory of the world.</p>

                    <h2 class="green">The Idea</h2>
                    <p>The first idea I had of this story was the image of a girl on a beach with a single coin, seeking to make a wish. Her choices were to throw it in a talking fountain, or give it to a talking dragon.</p>
                    <h2 class="green">Current Progress</h2>
                    <p>Over the past year, the idea has grown tremendously, and I am currently working on draft three, sitting at 73,000 words.</p>
                    <p>I plan to pursue traditional publishing, and will begin querying when the entire manuscript feels polished from beginning to end.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in project updates or providing feedback on an early draft, <a class="orange-link" href="https://forms.gle/jWHf5TPyW7ySptJL9">please consider filling out this form.</a></p>
                    <p>So for now I am in the "editing trenches". If you are there as well, I ask that we meet up occasionally to barter supplies. I am looking for motivation in exchange for some old cans of diced tomatoes.</p>

                    <h2 class="green">Goals</h2>
                    <p>There was a time that finishing a first draft of a novel-length project felt to me the achievement of a lifetime, and now the memory of that struggle is pure nostalgia.</p>
                    <p>So then I do not need to fear if publication feels impossible, and instead I will enjoy each edit I make in the meantime, knowing that once I transition, there will be no returning to these days either.</p>
                    <p>My main goal continues to be a life where I have time to write. I have it, even if only in evenings and weekends. Whatever success I find, I will use it to claim more time for writing.</p>

            <h2 class="green">Chapter One Excerpt</h2>
            <p>A dragon’s name is only spoken once before it is forgotten.</p>
<p>In exchange for the memory, the sound lingers, and has no choice but to be written on the world. Most often, a cave is formed in whatever lies close at hand, and the egg is placed inside. Any material will do, and there have been dragons born in havens hewn from merely the ground or the very water. In this case, his name was written into a mountain, and he laid there long enough for time to define both the dragon and the stone.</p>
<p>For the cave, the facets had become like mirrors for the dragon’s hue, such that if you were able to find it on the right day, you would mistake the alcove for a rich emerald mine. On another day, attempting to show others, the cave would instead be filled with amethyst or tourmaline, citrine or alexandrite, and you wouldn’t know it is because dragons never stay the same color for long. Your eyes would always find the gems that match him for the length of his life, no matter how far away he ventured or what new colors he found.</p>
<p>When the dragon emerged, his scales were mostly slate driven green, and slightly darker was the fur that started above his eyes between two copper horns, and ran down the full length of his body and a little past his tail. For his name, assuming you will not in fact have the opportunity to stumble inside and struggle to pronounce the facets, he would eventually be known by another name, one that would not be forgotten. In fact, there are people even now that when the right oddly shaped shadow passes by them backed by star-light, a thought occurs unaccountable to them, and they will whisper the name Santiago.</p>
