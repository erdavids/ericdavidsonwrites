        <h2 class="green">Why write?</h2>
            <p>I've read and loved too many stories to not contribute my own.</p>
            <p>Consider the following quote from my favorite book, The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle:</p>
            <p>"Your name is a golden bell hung in my heart. I would break my body to pieces to call you once by your name."</p>
            <p>Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever read? I read lines like that, and I feel overwhelmed when I realize the power language has to evoke emotion. It is a kind of power I want to accumulate, and harness, and affect others the way I have been affected.</p>
            <p>I believe with all my heart that each person has a set of things within them that only they can bring into the world. If I painted, and endeavored to make something unique and original regardless of quality, I can bring something into the world that would not have existed unless I willed it to be so.</p>
            <p>It is no different with writing, or sculpting, or game design, or music. Because there are unique things within each of us, I think there is a certain responsibility to bring some of it out, in a discipline of your choosing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
            <h2 class="green">Sure, but why writing specifically?</h2>
<p>Amongst all the available disciplines, when I see things in the world that 'inspire' me, sentences are what come to mind. Most often they are potential first lines of any number of novels.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the romantization of a writer's lifestyle appeals to me. The idea that great success would bring me the opportunity to live secluded at the base of a mountain, surrounded only by a field full of Forget-Me-Nots.</p>
