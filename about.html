            <p>I've read and loved too many stories to not contribute my own.</p>

<p>For the cave, the facets had become like mirrors for the dragon’s hue, such that if you were able to find it on the right day, you would mistake the alcove for a rich emerald mine. On another day, attempting to show others, the cave would instead be filled with amethyst or tourmaline, citrine or alexandrite, and you wouldn’t know it is because dragons never stay the same color for long. Your eyes would always find the gems that match him for the length of his life, no matter how far away he ventured or what new colors he found.</p>
<p>When the dragon emerged, his scales were mostly slate driven green, and slightly darker was the fur that started above his eyes between two copper horns, and ran down the full length of his body and a little past his tail. For his name, assuming you will not in fact have the opportunity to stumble inside and struggle to pronounce the facets, he would eventually be known by another name, one that would not be forgotten. In fact, there are people even now that when the right oddly shaped shadow passes by them backed by star-light, a thought occurs unaccountable to them, and they will whisper the name Santiago.</p>
