                <p>Get yourself a little frog thing that has a book, and within three weeks, you'll be on the NYT Bestsellers list. If you don't believe me, just take another look, buddy.</p>

            <h2 class="green">The Truth</h2>
            <p>I have no idea what I'm doing, and I don't have the credentials yet to convince you to listen to me. There are thousands of other resources related to the craft of writing that I would recommend you check out instead of what I can provide.</p>
            <p>This is the advice you're actually looking for: <a class="orange-link" href="/seven-wishes.html">Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott</a></p>
            <p>What I can do however is tell you what worked for me. There was a time that I thought I would never finish a first draft, and now I have one. Something must have changed, because at a fundamental level, someone that thought it was impossible could not have done it.</p>
            <p>Through a long combination of learning, practice, and a little trickery on my part, I was able to convince myself that it was possible, even probable, and even went as far as to do it. I'm extremely proud of my efforts, and now I'm convinced that I'll be able to finish the first draft of any story I set out to complete. On the chance that someone would read this that responds to things similarly to myself, this resource is for you.</p>
            <h2 class="green">The Fundamental Shift</h2>
            <p>I alluded to this above, but it all starts with belief.</p>
            <p>There's a quote that says, "You don't get what you want in life, you get what you are."</p>
            <p>Do you believe, truly, that you are capable of completing a first draft?</p>
            <p>The best thing you can do for yourself is to say no, and go grab a wheelbarrow so we can remake this foundation. I left some gloves on the back of the truck, and I hope you didn't make plans for dinner, because we're having cold hot dogs (gluten free buns).</p>
            <p>I had no choice but to start with making myself believe it was possible, because up to a certain point, I had to accept that I was working endlessly on something I wasn't sure I could do.</p>
            <p>Now you may say, "Of course it's possible, I just can't do it!" I'll leave you to understand my issue with that statement.</p>
            <p>I knew that if I could believe it was possible, then the rest would happen given time and effort. All I would do after that point is move up the date of my accomplishments, and increase the quality of my writing.</p>
            <p>So I started with the absolute basics, ones that I could prove to myself.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a coherent sentence?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a coherent paragraph?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a coherent page?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a coherent chapter?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write down a summary of the story?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write down a summary of each chapter?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I build enough details on top of my summaries so that my chapters reach a reasonable length?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I read something I've written, hate it, and leave it alone for now?</p>
            <p>I'll talk more about some of these, but you may recognize a sticking point at the end, and surely that is the step that gets most people. I was unwilling to accept that it was part of the 'possible' belief, somehow convincing myself that I could write a first draft, but also couldn't accept the imperfections.</p>
            <p>This issue is wrapped up in a misunderstanding of what the first draft is, so let's address that, and then come back to the belief.</p>
            <h2 class="green">Understand What The First Draft Is</h2>
            <p>When I asked myself, "Am I capable of writing a first draft?" and would run from the mirror as my reflection peeled itself away and chased me, I was always answering a different question, because I was never really working on the first draft.</p>
            <p>What I was working on was the final draft, and so of course I was having trouble making progress, I had skipped the first draft entirely! When I evaluated my work and my progress, I was listening to the imaginary comments of a mother and child in a bookstore, where the child asks for my novel, and the mother says, "No, son, I read that once, and it was so bad it ruined my life. Haven't you wondered why your father left?"</p>
            <p>So, if you are to change your beliefs, and be honest about your ability to finish the first draft, you also need to understand what the first draft is.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> The first draft is meant to be the most imperfect representation of your story</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> The first draft does not have to impress anyone, especially not you</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> The first draft does not need to be compared against any other work, especially published novels</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> The first draft is infinitely easier to improve when it exists</p>
            <p>If you can accept what the first draft is, you don't try to skip it, and you allow yourself to read bad writing, then I see no reason why you shouldn't believe. Then you're allowed to ask slightly deeper questions that will test a slightly stronger belief...</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a compelling sentence?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a compelling paragraph?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a compelling page?</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> Can I write a compelling chapter?</p>
            <p>Keep in mind, believing is not just a one time thing. One day you will believe, and another day you will lament as that belief slips away. Be prepared to revisit your foundation again and again.</p>
            <h2 class="green">Okay, I believe (for now), what's next?</h2>
            <p>Now, for the great secret. I have found a way of writing a book that does not require sitting down and writing. A way to create a first draft without going one word at a time. A different approach for you to take than the thousands that came before, the thousands that are writing even now, and the thousands that will write. A new way.</p>
            <p>If you got excited, sit down, and give me back the hot dog.</p>
            <p>There is no new way. There are new methods, new approaches, new strategies, new mentalities, new ways of creating communities, new ways of working with others, new examples, new tools, but there is only one way to write.</p>
            <p>You find a place to sit or stand or lie or fly or float or fall, and you write.</p>
            <p>You write.</p>
            <p>You are a writer.</p>
            <p>Do it at a pace of one word per second, and you'll still complete your draft.</p>
            <p>Do it at a pace of one word per minute, and you'll still complete your draft.</p>
            <p>Do it at a pace of one word per month... and we may need to discuss longevity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="green">But I run out of ideas?</h2>
            <p>Any writer understands that one idea for a story is not enough.</p>
            <p>You need ideas for the progression, for each chapter, even ideas for the conversations and individual voices of the characters. Every sentence and quote represents an idea, and it can be overwhelming when you have a sense of what you want the story to be, but it feels like you are running dry when it comes to the details.</p>
            <p>All I know is that if you are welcoming to the ideas that you do have, you make more time for them, you make their living quarters as comfortable as possible, you keep asking them questions and showing interest, the more likely it is they will tell their friends that they've found a writer worth checking out.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="green">Okay, I believe and I write, what's next?</h2>
            <p>I reached a point where I knew I could complete my draft, and I was comfortable spending time writing, and I realized that if I changed nothing, I would complete my first draft.</p>
            <p>Only then was I allowed to experiment with things that either reduced the time it would take me to finish my draft, or would slightly (don't get greedy) increase the quality of the first draft.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the things I experimented with that made a big difference for me...</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I set a word goal of 35,000 words, because I learned I was an underwriter, knowing that I could go over or expand later, and only then beg society to forgive me for breaking the rules</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I used my birthday and falling star wishes wisely</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I tried to write at least a little every day, even if they were just notes on my phone, or quotes, or scenes</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I continually revisited my chapter summaries, and added enough details that it could lightly communicate the events of the entire story</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I defined a core scene for each chapter that I was excited to write</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I tried to end writing sessions when I could on a high note, and carried that excitement into the next session</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I spent time in places that inspired me, such as coffee shops and book stores</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I kept a supply of books with writing I believed I could surpass</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I kept a supply of books with writing I did not think I could match, but aspired to</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">> I tried to accept that writing a draft may be as far as I ever get in the process of being an 'author'</p>
            <p>Are you willing to try these? If you have trouble writing in the evenings, are you willing to try writing in the morning? Are you willing to fight yourself for time spent doing what you know you long to do?</p>
            <p>Do you want to be a writer?</p>
            <h2 class="green">Destiny</h2>
            <p>Alright, it is time to risk it all. The answer. The true foundation of my own ability to write a crude draft.</p>
            <p>Each of us is capable of creating things totally unique, and it is our destiny to do so.</p>
            <p>I don't mean that you have no choice, I just mean that if you write, and attempt to create something original, then you will add something new to the world that could not have existed otherwise.</p>
            <p>Combine that with your desire to be a writer, and you've got a destiny brewing.</p>
            <p>I believe with all my heart that I have stories to tell, and I enjoy breathing life into them. I enjoy looking at a blank page, and looking back on it after it is filled. I enjoy when I take a sip of my coffee and realize it went cold. I enjoy deleting a part of a chapter that I've finally accepted just doesn't work.</p>
            <p>There are times I don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy when it has been a week and I've made no progress. I don't enjoy feeling like all my ideas have been done before and better than I could hope. I don't enjoy reading what I've written and realizing I'm the worst humanity has to offer.</p>
            <p>But I do enjoy it, because I'm a writer. I write, and I enjoy it.</p>
            <p>I recognize the more welcoming I am to the ideas that come to me, the more time I make for them, the more comfortable I make their living quarters, the more questions and interest I show them, the more likely it is they will tell their friends that they've found a writer worth checking out.</p>
